# customer-personality-analysis
day-1 task submission

For the 1st task, I cleaned the dataset. 

I used Excel (since the dataset was not too large, I didn't find the need to use Python). 
1. I de-eleminated the columns and made separate columns of the combined column name.
2. I checked for the blanks in income and deleted all the rows where the income isn't available  (since, without the income of the customer, the data is irrelevant).
3. I removed all the duplicate rows.
4. I changed the Format of several columns to date, numbers, etc., wherever required.
